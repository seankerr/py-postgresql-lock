class Lock:
    """
    Lock mechanism implemented with Postgres advisory locks.

    Default operation is session lock scope and blocking mode and is sufficient for distributed
    locks. The database interface will be detected automatically.

    Database interfaces:
        - asyncpg
            - asynchronous
        - psycopg2
            - synchronous
        - psycopg3
            - asynchronous
            - synchronous
        - sqlalchemy (supports version 1 & 2; can use any underlying database interface)
            - asynchronous
            - synchronous

    Lock scopes:
        - session: only a single session can hold the lock
        - transaction: only a single transaction within a single session can hold the lock

    Modes:
        - blocked: do not return until the lock is acquired
        - nonblocking: return immediately with or without the lock being acquired

    Sharing (locks can or cannot be reacquired from the same scope)
